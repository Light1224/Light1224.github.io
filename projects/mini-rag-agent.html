				<h1>Mini RAG Agent</h1>

				<p>
					Mini RAG Agent is a minimal, end-to-end implementation of a
					Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system built to make every
					stage of the pipeline explicit, inspectable, and persistent.
				</p>

				<h2>Motivation</h2>
				<p>
					Modern RAG systems are often hidden behind large frameworks that
					abstract away core ideas such as chunking, retrieval, vector storage,
					and grounding. This project was built to understand those mechanisms
					from first principles by implementing a complete RAG pipeline with
					no heavy abstractions and no black-box orchestration.
				</p>

				<h2>System Architecture</h2>
				<p>
					The system is organized into a small number of clearly separated
					components, each with a single responsibility. The diagram below
					shows the high-level data flow for both document ingestion and
					query execution.
				</p>

				<h2>Frontend</h2>
				<p>
					The frontend is a lightweight browser interface implemented using
					plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Its role is limited to user
					interaction: uploading text documents, submitting questions, and
					displaying responses. All application logic and state management
					reside on the backend.
				</p>

				<h2>Backend Runtime</h2>
				<p>
					The backend is implemented as a FastAPI application served via
					Uvicorn. Uvicorn provides the ASGI runtime responsible for request
					handling and asynchronous execution, while FastAPI defines the
					application layer that orchestrates ingestion, retrieval, and
					model interaction.
				</p>
				<p>
					The backend itself is stateless. Each request is handled
					independently, and all persistent data is stored in the database.
					This design keeps execution deterministic and restart-safe.
				</p>

				<h2>Persistent Storage</h2>
				<p>
					PostgreSQL is used as the system’s persistent storage layer. It
					stores uploaded documents, chunked text segments, vector
					embeddings, and metadata linking chunks to their source documents.
				</p>
				<p>
					Instead of relying on a specialized vector database, PostgreSQL
					was chosen to keep the storage model explicit and easy to inspect.
					This prioritizes clarity and correctness over scalability, which
					aligns with the project’s educational goals.
				</p>

				<h2>Model Runtime</h2>
				<p>
					Ollama is used as a local model runtime and serves two roles within
					the system. First, it generates embeddings for both document
					chunks and user queries. Second, it generates grounded answers
					using retrieved context and the user’s question.
				</p>
				<p>
					Ollama is treated as a pure computation service with no hidden
					state. All orchestration, prompt construction, and retrieval logic
					remain within the backend.
				</p>

				<h2>Execution Flow</h2>
				<p>
					The system operates in two primary phases. During document
					ingestion, uploaded text files are chunked, embedded, and stored
					persistently. During query execution, the user’s question is
					embedded, relevant chunks are retrieved via vector similarity,
					and a grounded response is generated using the retrieved context.
				</p>
				<p>
					There is no conversational memory; each query is processed
					independently to ensure predictable behavior.
				</p>

				<h2>Limitations</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Supports plain text documents only</li>
					<li>No advanced retrieval techniques such as reranking or hybrid search</li>
					<li>No distributed or scalable vector storage</li>
					<li>No authentication, observability, or production hardening</li>
				</ul>

				<h2>Status</h2>
				<p>
					Completed as a learning-focused system and reference
					implementation.
				</p>
